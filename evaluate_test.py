#anfrage = "This video was very helpful. As a beginning vocalist this video showed me new techniques much needed to succeed. Melissa cross is amazing!"
anfrage = "This is the best way to find out what to do when you're completelylost and all you can get is choir lessons... If you are a metal singer and wish to improve, Melissa's the best you can get..."
#anfrage = "The short review: Buy it and use Cross's advice and exercises!I've had Melissa Cross's \"The Zen of Screaming: Vocal Instruction for a New Breed\" for about a month and the breathing exercises and the advice on \"Heat and Fire\" payed off for me.  Today, I was able to put forth lots and lots of tortured death-metal screams and shrieks and am not only not hoarse, but was able to intersperse the screaming and yelling with clean, melodic singing.  It was actually less taxing on my vocal folds and larynx than when I try to sing opera as a dramatic baritone (it took death metal screaming to tell me I'm a lighter voice - thanks, death metal and Miss Cross!).  And, since I was practicing to \"The Wonder Pets\" theme and \"What's New Pussycat?\" while mowing the lawn, I probably freaked out my neighbors.When you buy this DVD (and you are, aren't you?), please note that the actual screaming/yelling/rasping section is fairly short and it comes after a lot of segments on breathing and some vocal exercises.  Do not underestimate either the importance of proper breathing nor the value of the \"Heat and Fire\" segment.  If you've ever torn up your throat singing raspy or beyond raspy and thought screaming was a quick, dead-end stop for your singing career (even if your career would be entirely screaming), you need to learn how to breathe properly and how to use \"heat\" to add rasping harmonics to your voice and \"fire\" to make use of the false vocal folds.Another great thing about this DVD is that Melissa Cross doesn't want to change your voice or change your singing style; she wants you to be able to do your own thing with your own voice over the course of your own lifetime.  Very good stuff!"
